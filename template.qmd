While displacement may have many causes, our interest in technological displacement requires a further elaboration of our conceptual framework: how to attribute labor displacement to technological change. In the best case, authors of studies would observe employers stating that workers are being displaced because of the adoption of new technology. This is an exceedingly rare occurrence. Instead, most authors look for the temporal coincidence of technological adoption and displacement of workers whose jobs overlapped with the new technology.
